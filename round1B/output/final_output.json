Introduction\nDrug discovery involves identifying compounds that can modulate biological targets. Machine learning\nmodels, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have emerged as effective tools for molecular property\nprediction.\n2. Methodologies\nWe discuss key GNN architectures such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention\nNetworks (GATs), and Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). These models can learn from molecular\ngraphs to predict drug-like properties.\n3. Datasets\nPopular datasets include MoleculeNet, PubChemBioAssay, and ChEMBL. These datasets provide molecular\nstructures and activity labels for benchmarking.\n4. Benchmarks and Performance\nBenchmark studies show that GNNs outperform traditional fingerprint-based methods in QSAR tasks. We\npresent performance metrics across datasets.\n5. Conclusion\nGNNs hold grea"
